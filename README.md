# Convolutional Ensembling based Few-Shot Defect Detection
Technique
A novel CNN based ensembling technique for Few-Shot Defect Detection, which reduces the parameter count while improving the performances. The model was employed in a  practical scenario of detecting faults in large powerline grids. The model was able to outperform all the previous competitors on most of the standard datasets.
